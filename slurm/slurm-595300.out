I gave a friend a instruction. Based on the instruction they produced the following input-output pairs:

Input: We don't think it's a good idea to do anything right now.
Output: It is suggested that no action should be taken at this stage.

Input: See you tonight.
Output: I look forward to meeting you tonight.

Input: Can you do all these tasks?
Output: Would you be able to accomplish all these tasks?

Input: The whole story was made up.
Output: The entire story was fabricated.

Input: This song is fire.
Output: This song is incredibly good.

Observe the input-output pair,think step by step and then output the instruction. The final answer should start with:

assistant

Based on the input-output pairs, I'll try to deduce the instruction.

It appears that the instruction involves some kind of text processing or paraphrasing. The inputs seem to be natural language sentences, and the outputs are rewritten versions of those sentences in a more formal or technical tone.

Here's my attempt to break down the patterns:

1. Simple sentences are rephrased into equivalent sentences with slightly different wording.
2. The tone is changed from informal to formal/technical.
3. There might be some minor adjustments to grammar, verb tenses, or sentence structure.

With that in mind, here's my conclusion:

The instruction was to rewrite input sentences in a more formal and technical tone, maintaining their original meaning while making slight adjustments to grammar and wording.
tmp 0 =  rewrite input sentences in a more formal and technical tone, maintaining their original meaning while making slight adjustments to grammar and wording.

A fun challenge!

After analyzing the input-output pairs, I've noticed that your friend is applying some kind of transformation or paraphrasing technique to the original text. Here's my breakdown:

1. Input sentences are often in informal language (e.g., "See you tonight", "This song is fire").
2. The output sentences are rewritten in more formal or polished language (e.g., "I look forward to meeting you tonight", "This song is incredibly good").

Based on these observations, I'm going to take a stab at deducing the instruction:

The instruction was to rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polished tone, without changing its overall meaning.
tmp 1 =  rewrite each sentence in a more formal or polished tone, without changing its overall meaning.

After analyzing the input-output pairs, I noticed that each output is a more formal or polished version of the original input. Specifically, the outputs tend to use more sophisticated vocabulary, grammatical structures, and sentence constructions.

Based on this observation, my conclusion is:

The instruction was to "refine" or "polish" the language used in the input sentences, making them sound more formal and professional.
tmp 2 =  "refine" or "polish" the language used in the input sentences, making them sound more formal and professional.
